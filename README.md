# simplex_method_proj

This is a project made on my SICI4028 (Operation investigation in computers) class. It calculates an approximate solution based on the simplex method, it can handle minimize and maximize problems, with a dynamic number of constraints, and also converts the constraints to the correct equality symbols. The output shows the steps to be taken so the solution can be reached.
