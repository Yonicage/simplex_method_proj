# simplex_method_proj

This is a project was made on my SICI4028 (Operation investigation in computers) class as a project. It calculates an aproximate solution based on the simplex method, it can handle minimize and maximize problems, with dynamic number of constraints and also converts the constraints to the correct equality symbols. The out put shows the steps to be taken so the solution can be reached.
